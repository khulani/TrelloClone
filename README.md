[Live][live]

A web app that clones the basic functionality of Trello.  

You can create 'boards'. Within a 'board', you can create 'lists'. And within a 'list', you can create many 'cards'. 
Also, you can rearrange the order of your 'lists' via dragging.
The same can be done with 'cards'. You can even drag 'cards' from one 'list' to another.
